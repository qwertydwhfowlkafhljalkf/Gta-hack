## Using the cheat
1. Download the latest compiled version (GTAV.dll) from the [Releases page](https://github.com/HatchesPls/GrandTheftAutoV-Cheat/releases)
2. Use your favorite injector to inject the cheat file into GTA5.exe. It is important to inject using the LoadLibrary method without any obfuscation or post injection cleanup, the cheat does **not** work when the cheat is manually mapped into the game process. If you don't know any module injectors, see [this](https://github.com/HatchesPls/SimpleModuleInjector) Github repository for a great injector for this project.
